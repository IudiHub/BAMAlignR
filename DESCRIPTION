Description: BAMAlignR is a comprehensive R package designed to empower users with an interactive experience in exploring and visualizing read alignments from BAM/SAM files to a reference genome. Through a user-friendly interface, the package enables individuals to pinpoint and focus on specific read entries, unlocking a deep understanding of the alignment process. By visually unraveling how a read's sequence aligns to the reference genome using its corresponding CIGAR string, users can extract crucial insights and make informed decisions regarding their genomic data.
